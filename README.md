## Project Overview

This Python script processes a text file to compute and count the frequency of each word in the file. The results are sorted in descending order based on word frequency and written to a new file. The program is interactive, allowing users to input the names of both the source text file and the file where results will be stored.

## Introduction

The purpose of this program is to:
1. Read and process a text file.
2. Count and sort word occurrences in the file.
3. Output the results into a neatly formatted file for easy review.

This tool is particularly useful for analyzing text files, identifying frequent terms, or preparing data for further linguistic analysis.

## Features
- Removes puncutation and processes words in a case-insensitive manner.
- Handles missing or invalid files with proper error messages.
- Outputs results to a user-specificed file in a formatted manner.
- Calculates and displays the total number of unique words in the text.

## How It Works
1. Reading and cleaning the data
2. Sorting and Formatting
3. user Interaction
4. Main Functionality

## Usage Instructions
1. Run the script in a Python environment.
2. Enter the name of the text file to process when prompted.
3. Enter the desired name for the output file.
4. The program will process the file and save the results to the specified output file.

## Future Improvements
- Add support for processing multiple files simultaneously.
- Include options for case-sensitive analysis.
- Add the ability to ignore stop words such as "the", "and", and "is".
